        My name's Tomi, and I'm a self-taught developer.
        As of now I'm trying my best to setup a Multi-Framework testing suite
        for a web app with Zabbix and CI/CD integrations implemented.

        In addition to my main job, I'm also trying to find time for 
        my own projects. These include BottleBuddy, a mobile app 
        for recycled bottle pickups; and Masetro, a universal 
        utility app for everyone.

        This is version 1.0.0 of my personal website, which I'll be 
        semi-regularly updating and using to log my dev life :]
