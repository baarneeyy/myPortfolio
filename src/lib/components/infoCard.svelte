As of now I'm trying my best to setup a Multi-Framework testing suite
for a web app with Zabbix and CI/CD integrations implemented.

In addition to my main job, I'm also trying to find time for 
my own projects. These include BottleBuddy, a mobile app 
for recycled bottle pickups; and Masetro, a universal 
utility app for everyone.

This is version 1.0.0 of my personal website, which I'll be 
semi-regularly updating and using to log my dev life :]`
